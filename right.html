        <h1>BRIEF ABOUT GVPCE</h1>
        <p>The Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering [GVPCE] had 
            its humble beginning in December 1996 with 4 branches and 200 intake established 
            under the parent society ‘Gayatri Vidya Parishad’(GVP), a non-profitable organization
             comprising of noted educationists and eminent philanthropists who have a missionary zeal to
              provide quality technical education. From that point on, the college has very quickly 
              established itself as one of the most-preferred self-financing engineering colleges in 
              Andhra Pradesh offering 10 B.Tech. Programs, 9 M.Tech. and one MCA Program approved by AICTE 
              with an intake of 1362.</p>
